	A JavaScript variable can hold values of many different types like numbers, text, booleans, dates etc. These are called intrinsic types in the sense that they are natively supported by the language in any environment (host). Depending on where the code is executed, there may be other host-specific data types available. If the data types provided by the language are not sufficient to describe concepts that need to be present in the program the language provides the means so that a programmer can define them. Therefore, the data types in JavaScript can be categorised as follows:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Intrinsic data types</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Primitive data types</li>
				<li>Object data types</li>
			</ul>
		<li>User defined data types</li>
		<li>Host data types</li>
	</ul>

			Static or Dynamic Typing?

		<p>
		JavaScript is using a dynamic typing system. That means that the type of a variable does not need to be specified before its creation. A variable can change types during the course of the program execution. The type of a variable is determined dynamically depending on the values it receives.
		</p>
		<p>
		Another characteristic of dynamic typing is that the language permits operations between values of different types. Implicit type inference is used in this case to determine dynamically possible compatible combinations. Both of these two features can be especially dangerous for inexperienced programmers.
