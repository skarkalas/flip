		JavaScript is a programming language that was initially introduced by Netscape in 1995. The intention was to use this language to provide dynamic content in web browsers without the need for a server roundtrip. This effort was embraced by other manufacturers and as a result of that the ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) was born. In December 1999 ECMA approved and released the 3rd edition of a standard that defines the specification of the ECMAScript language. This specification is known as 'ECMA 262 language specification' or as 'ECMAScript Edition 3'. JavaScript, as we know it today, is the most popular implementation of this specification.

		JavaScript is a scripting language. That means that there is no compiler that can be used to create executable binaries. The translation process can only be performed by an interpreter which has to be used every time we need to execute JavaScript code.

		This language is not designed for programs that can perform autonomously but rather for programs that complement already existing systems. The purpose of these programs is usually to add more functionality (or exploit already existing functionality) to existing systems that act as their hosts. JavaScript was initially designed to be used within web browsers and but nowadays more host environments have become available.

		Typically JavaScript is used to add behaviour to a web page. Nowadays, there are many other host environments that expose scripting interfaces through which JavaScript can integrate with them. The following is by no means an extensive list:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Stand-alone applications that make full use of the underlying OS (Windows) functionality for any task required (HTA).</li>
			<li>Component-based development for local or distributed applications (WSC, under Windows).</li>
			<li>Operating system administration scripting (WSH, WMI, LDAP etc., under Windows).</li>
			<li>Server-side scripting for dynamically generated web pages (ASP).</li>
			<li>Database programming either at the front end (browser) or at the back end.</li>
			<li>Server-side programming (node.js, rhino).</li>
			<li>GIS programming (Google Maps API etc.).</li>
			<li>Facebook programming.</li>
			<li>Robot programming (autonomous robotics).</li>
			<li>Development for any application that provides a scripting API (MS Office etc.).</li>
		</ul>
