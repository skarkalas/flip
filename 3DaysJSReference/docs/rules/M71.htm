		A variable is declared in a loop

	<p>
	Variables in JavaScript have function scope. Declaring a variable in a loop does not restrict its scope within
	it. In that respect it is not a problem if the intention is to use its value after the loop. The following is 
	permissible by the language but it is clearly incorrect:
	</p>
<pre>
<code>
var i;
for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
{
 var sum = 0;
 sum += x[i];
}
text.write(sum, '\n');
</code>
</pre>	
	<p>
	 The first problem is that this code is misleading and potentially dangerous. Even if the declaration is left
	 uninitialised the code is problematic. It is much better to move the declaration before the loop.

<pre>
<code>
var sum = 0;
var i;
for (i = 0; i <= 5; i++)
{
 sum += x[i];
}
text.write(sum, '\n');
</code>
