	<p>
	There is a reference in the code that implies that the Math or the JSON object can be used as a function.
	</p>
<pre>
<code>
x = Math();
y = JSON();
</code>
</pre>

	 These are objects that exist in the system to provide services. These objects have properties and functions but
	 they should not be considered as functions themselves.
