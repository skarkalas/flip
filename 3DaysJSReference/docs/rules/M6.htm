		A variable is used before its declaration

	<p>
	Technically it is not a problem to refer to a variable before its declaration. The variable exists anyway within
	its scope (global or function) and before its declaration contains the value 'undefined'. The following is not
	invalid:
	</p>
<pre>
<code>
x = 10;
var x = 5;
</code>
</pre>	
	<p>
	 However, it is not a good practice to write code like the above. It is potentially dangerous because the first
	 reference might not be an assignment operation. You should always declare the variable first and then use it.
