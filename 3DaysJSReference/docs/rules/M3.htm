		A variable is referenced outside of its scope

	Variables in JavaScript have function scope. Declaring a variable in a block does not restrict its scope within
	that block. Therefore, technically the following is not a problem as it is permissible by the language:
	</p>
<pre>
<code>
function f(a)
{
    if (a > 4)
    {
        var x = 1;
    }
    
    return x;
}
</code>
</pre>	
	<p>
	 However, if the argument a is less than or equal to 4, the returned value is 'undefined'. This is probably not
	 intended by the programmer. In any case it is better practice to declare variables outside of blocks and pretend
	 that block scope exists.
	</p>
<pre>
<code>
function f(a)
{
    var x = 0;
    
    if (a > 4)
    {
        x = 1;
    }
    
    return x;
}
</code>
